# NODE JS + RESTFUL API
    REST - Representational State Transfer

Constraints of RESTFUL:

    - Client-Server Architecture
    ( Separation of Concerns RESTful API should not care abouut UI)

    - Stateless
    (No Client-Context is stored on the server)

    - Cacheability
    (Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non cacheable)

    - Layered System
    (Intermediate Servers maybe used without the client knowing about it)

    - Uniform Interface
    (Resources are identified in requests, transferred data is decoupled DB)
    ( Self-descriptive Messages Links to further Resources)

    - Code on Demand
    (Executable code could be transferred)
